sea captain has a hook hand, but a part of the murder obviously requires both hands?

what if everybody gets told they're the murderer, but each of them did the murder by setting a cunning trap and each one also has evidence to show that someone else's trap failed

ways to set a trap that fails

* poisoned the drink ( the drink got switched )
* carbon monoxide leak (open window)
* brick them up in the cellar (got out)
* lock them in the freezer (let out by service staff, found a sweater)
* blow them up (set the fuse wrong)
* hired a hitman to kill them (hired a hitman to kill the wrong person)
* dropped an anvil on them (accidentally dropped an anvil on someone else)
* poison blowdart (forgot to put the poison on the blowdart)
* cut in half with wire or twine (target is not tall enough)
* pushed off of a roof (he fell on to a trampoline)

pool/bar/kitchen - drowning, drink, freezer, poison blowdart
bedroom/bathroom: monoxide, heart pills, struggle/drowning
