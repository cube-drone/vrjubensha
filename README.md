## A Whole Yacht of Murder

(look, I get it, the name isn't great)

This is a design document for an interactive game where six players and a seventh player, the "host", work together to solve a mystery that has taken place on a yacht. 

This is designed to be both _relatively short_ (playable in under an hour) and relatively easy (most people should be able to solve it, it requires no outside information, and it's designed to be as intuitive as possible without hand-holding).

This mystery has _one, fixed solution_ and so most players will only enjoy playing through it once. Once they've played through the game once, they can host in future games.
