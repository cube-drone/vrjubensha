### Environmental Details
* (Black's bags) a few large gaudy white trunks next to a small black handbag and a small black suit bag. 
* (Star's bags) a large, modern, yellow unit of rolling luggage and a second yellow plastic case with tripods and film equipment. 
* (Plum's bags) a floral, plum-colored bag is waiting to be loaded. It's small but expensive looking.

the Host can see: 
* After letting characters mill around a little bit, ask them to get in single file, then introduce themselves and sit on the pontoon boat. 
* You can pretend to be a boat attendant if you'd like to keep the scene in-character. In that case, remember to salute Captain Orange.
* Once everybody has done this, you can instruct them to move to the next scene.
