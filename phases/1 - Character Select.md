Players spawn in The Backstage. The Backstage is dressed up to look like the backstage of a theatrical production. There are several dressing rooms. 

Everybody spawns Backstage and chooses one of seven doors, each marked with a symbol: 

* An Orange Ship
* A Red Chef's Hat
* A Green Magnifying Glass
* A Yellow Star
* A Violet Flower
* A Black Bow-Tie

The seventh door is clearly marked as HOST, for people who have already played the game. 

There's an eighth door, marked SPECTATOR, for extras. 

The goal of the game is explained: to solve the murder of Victor Tam, by finding the murderer, their motive, and their weapon.
