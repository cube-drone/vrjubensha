Each character is once again ushered into separate dressing rooms where they can read their notes for the next segment.

Victor Tam has been murdered! His body is found floating in the Yacht's pool, with a bottle of whiskey floating next to him in the pool.  
## Set
This set is the primary set that will be used for the bulk of the story. 
### The Pool
This is a large area and the place where the players enter the story. This pool is on the back of the boat, and floating in the pool, face-down, is the body of Victor Tam, who is wearing a white suit. His skin is blue. There's no blood. 

Around the edge of the pool are deck chairs. Next to the pool is a pool bar area, which is covered by the Master Bedroom.

Printed on the pool's floor is "Victor Tam, billionaire, found dead in the pool of his yacht. No visible injuries."
### Pool Bar
On the bar is a very visible glass of whiskey. It's pretty full. There's no ice in the glass(the ice in it has melted).

**Everyone** can see "Victor Tam's whiskey."
**Florist Plum** can see "You poisoned Victor Tam's whiskey, at 7 pm, with deadly foxglove."
**Star Yellow** can see "You sniff the drink and it smells wrong."
**Butler Black** can see "I poured Victor Tam a few drinks last night but he didn't touch them, he decided to drink straight out of the bottle."
**Detective Green** can see "The old man always did love his whiskey. Once he told you that he loved it more than he loved his children. He was probably joking."
### Grand Table
Near the pool bar is a big table with physics interactibles that players can simply move around to keep track of the state of the story. 

On the table are six beverage bottles, each colored orange, red, green, plum, yellow, or black. "Orange Soda", "Red Ale", "Green Apple Cooler", "Plum Cider", "Yellow Star Lager", "Black Coffee Porter". (There are more of these bottles around if players need more.)

There are also coasters marked "LOVE",  "MONEY", "REVENGE",  
And napkins with the words "POISON", "INVISIBLE GAS", "FROZEN", "DROWNED", "STRANGLED", "PILLS", "HEART ATTACK" scrawled on them. 

The only value of this Grand Table is to help players keep track of events in the story with a physical analogue. They can arrange these elements any way they like. There are spare elements located throughout the pool bar in case they need more. 
### Kitchen

### Kitchen Freezer
There is a bottle of amontillado in the freezer (it's frozen). The freezer door is dented and there's no way to open it from the inside.

**Everyone** can see "It's cold in here. Really cold."
**Chef Red** can see "You locked Victor Tam in the freezer at 9pm last night."
**Captain Orange** can see "The inside doorknob on this freezer door has been removed! This thing is dangerous!"
**Detective Green** can see "It looks like someone was banging at the inside of this door."
